# RevSimulatorProject

An Android game inspired by Adventure Capitalist and other idle/clicker games. You buy things, click things, get money and upgrade
your cash generators to make more money which you use to upgrade them. The game is in a playable state but many features are unfinished
and the presentation of the game leaves much to be desired. Furthermore debug features are present - such as the 'get money' button which would not be
present if the  game was fully finished.
